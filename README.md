#### What is it?
This badge was made for HOPE XIV in New York City.  It was inspired by the security device known as a "Spider Tag" and features circuity and a demo to act like a Retail Store security tag.  It also features the internals of real security tags on the bottom of the badge  (both 8.2 MHz and 58 kHz).

Badges must be picked up in-person at HOPE conference.

The badge has three modes:
1- Spider Badge Demo:
When the Link is broken, an alarm sounds, and is deactivated with a magnet (just like the real thing!)

2 - SH0PL1FT3RS RUN:
An interactive video game in which you jump over retail security gates

3 - Flashy Mode
This mode cycles through different LED animations and screens to show off during the conference.  You can run through the mode once, or keep looping it.

Included:
Electronic Spider Badge (Fully Assembled)
LiPo Battery
USB-C Cable
USB-C to USB-A Adapter
Alligator Clip
Magnet
Stickers (HOPE and DEF CON)

#### Why did you make it?
I'm giving a talk at HOPE covering Security Tags and thought it would be fun to make this!

#### What makes it special?
It's a one-of-a-kind badge that features Retail Security Tags
