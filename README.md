#### What is it?
This badge was made for DEF CON 30 and HOPE XIV.  It was inspired by the security device known as a "Spider Tag" and features circuity and a demo to act like a Retail Store security tag.  It also features the internals of real security tags on the bottom of the badge  (both 8.2 MHz and 58 kHz).

The badge has three modes:  
1- Spider Badge Demo:
When the Link is broken, an alarm sounds, and is deactivated with a magnet (just like the real thing!)

2 - SH0PL1FT3RS RUN:
An interactive video game in which you jump over retail security gates

3 - Flashy Mode
This mode cycles through different LED animations and screens to show off during the conference.  You can run through the mode once, or keep looping it.
